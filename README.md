This is my portfolio app Zorgon Ecommerce. It has full front-end and back-end, uses a real database, has full CRUD, authentication and authorization, a visitor is able to 'purchase' a listed product,
a visitor is able to 'register' as a vendor and upload his/her own products, and more. Site functionality is not 'real world' of course, it is a demo.

The project is hosted here: https://shielded-lowlands-81248.herokuapp.com/
